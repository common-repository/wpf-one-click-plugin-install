A simple WordPress plugin to install & activate a plugin from plugin installation page with only one click.

== Description ==
Since  WordPress v4.6.0 it supports ajax plugin installation which is great.
But if you want to install multiple plugins from the installation page it can install from there but for activating those  you have to go installed plugin page.

Using this plugin you can install multiple plugins from the plugin installation page and whenever a plugin is successfully installed it will be activated automatically.
